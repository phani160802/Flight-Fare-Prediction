# FLIGHT FARE PREDICTION USING RANDOM FOREST REGRESSION.
In this project, we estimated the price of the flight ticket by taking a dataset from Kaggle which has factors like departure_time, arrival_time, number_of_stops, and flights over a specific period of time. First, we preprocessed the data by applying feature engineering techniques. Then we applied various Machine Learning algorithms like Random Forest Regression on the data which is preprocessed to predict the ticket price and calculate the accuracy of each algorithm. The models are compared on various metrics such as â€“ Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), R2 error.
